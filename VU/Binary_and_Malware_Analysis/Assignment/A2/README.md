# Dump the inner binary

# Patch the inner binary
After having dumped the inner binary I tried to run it but I got a segmentation fault. Using tools such as `readelf`, `file` and `xxd` I realized that the ELF header was not correct. 
To completely understand what the problems were, I compared byte per byte the inner binary with a simple C binary. 
The first byte that I patched was the endianness one, which was set to Big Endian instead of Little Endian (so I patched it with `0x01`).
Always by comparing the inner binary with a simple one, I fixed these fields inside the header:
- the Machine type field wasn't X86_64 (so I patched it to `0x3E`)
- <span style="background:#fff88f">SectionHeaderOffset wasn't set to 0</span> (so I patched it to `0x00`)
- the number of entries in the section header table must be 0 (so I patched it to `0x00`)
- the index of the section header table entry that contains the section names must be `0`
  (so I patched it to `0x00`)

Since the inner binary was dumped from memory, the program offsets must be the same as those of the virtual program.
In 3 of them the addresses were not equal, so I patched them as well (all three had to be `0x4dc0` to be the same as the virtual offsets).

After these changes, by using `readelf` and `file` everything seemed correct and I was able to run the inner binary and connect to the VUVianConnector.
