# Dump the inner binary

# Patch the inner binary
After having dumped the inner binary I tried to run it but I got a segmentation fault. Using tools such as `readelf`, `file` and `xxd` I realized that the ELF header was not correct. 
To completely understand what the problems were, I compared byte per byte the inner binary with a simple C binary. 
The first byte that I patched was the endianness one, which was set to Big Endian instead of Little Endian (so I patched it with `0x01`).
Always by comparing the inner binary with a simple one, I fixed these bytes inside the header:
- the
