# System calls
The first thing that I found is that there is only one function that makes the system calls.
Every time that a system call is needed, its integer value is passed inside the EAX register and then this single function is called to perform the system call. So to "decrypt" all the system calls I searched what every system call number is associated to which call.

# Anti Debugging
In the binary I found 2 calls to ptrace.
Since only one debugger can be attached to a program at any time:
- the first ptrace call should return 0 (so that the binary can debug itself and bypass the check
- and consequently the second call should return -1 (because the binary is already being traced, so the correct value that ptrace should return is an error).

To patch these 2 calls I inserted, instead of the ptrace calls, the right returning values inside the register used to store the ptrace result. And where necessary I added NOP instructions to maintain the same number of bytes used by the original calls to ptrace.

# Anti VM and HW detection 
One of the functions within main is something like an encryption function.  It takes 3 parameters and It utilizes a loop to encrypt bytes in the second one using `XOR` operation with the constant `0x4a` and storing the results inside the first parameter.
By writing a simple program I could decrypt all the strings that I found inside the binary.

One other function in main is a string compare function. I found it twice:
the first strings comparison is with the VU AMSTERDAM string. 
Since the string_compare function returns 0 if the 2 compared strings are equal, I patched the first call to this function with `XOR EAX, EAX` and  three `NOP`s (because I believe that the VU AMSTERDAM comparison is related to the Platform Detection, so the function must return 0).
The second string comparison is with innotek_GmbH and I think that this comparison is one of the Anti VM checks, so I patched the second string_compare call with  `MOV EAX, 1`.
