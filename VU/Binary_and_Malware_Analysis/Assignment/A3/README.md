The first thing that I did was to fill some of the missing codes inside the framework.
I started editing the `handle_mov_memtomem` and `handle_mov_regtomem` functions.
In the first one, since we need to propagate the taints, the function should copying the taint values from the source memory to the destination memory.
For this reason I edited the for loop in this way:
`for (unsigned n = 0; n < N; ++n) {`
	`shadowTo[n] = shadowFrom[n];`
`}`
In the second one, for maintaining the integrity of taint information when data is moved from a register to memory, we should copy the taint value from the register `reg+n` to the corresponding byte in the memory shadow:
`for (unsigned n = 0; n < N; ++n) {`
	`shadow[n] = g_regTags[reg+n];` 
`}`

# Clear the taint
Before attempting the step 1, I implemented
