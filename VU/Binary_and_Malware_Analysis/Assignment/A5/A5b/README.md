# Adapt angr_bf’s I/O to the universe dialect
To adapt angr_bf’s I/O to the universe dialect, so that the `.` and `,` operations are self-incrementing, I modified the `simos_bf.py` file because these operations involve interaction with the operating system simulated by `simos_bf.py`.
These operations are implemented by simulated system calls, that are indeed handled by `simos_bf.py`.
So, I simply incremented the pointer after performing the corresponding I/O operations in both the 2 classes `ReadByteToPtr` and `WriteByteAtPtr` in this way:
`self.state.regs.ptr += 1`.

# Determine required input & recover 1st part of message
Then, I created an angr script to analyze the `universe.vbf` program.
I started by creating a blank state at address 0 within the project. Next, I defined a symbolic buffer of size 29 bytes, used to model incoming input through the standard input of the program. 
I then set the state input stream (that is what the program receives as input during execution) so that it is represented as a symbolic data stream, rather than as concrete data
