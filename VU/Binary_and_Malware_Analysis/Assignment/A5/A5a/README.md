# Find and explain conditions for syntactic/semantic validity
By analyzing the binary in Ghidra, within the `main` function I found the function that performs all the checks for the syntactic and semantic validation, since its return value is assigned to a variable and by checking its value the binary returns a string such as:
- Invalid input sequence
- Input sequence ... maps to:  ...
- Input sequence has no mapping

I called the function that does all these checks `check_synt_sem`.
