# Find and explain conditions for syntactic/semantic validity
By analyzing the binary in Ghidra, within the `main` function I found the function that performs all the checks for the syntactic and semantic validation, since its return value is assigned to a variable and by checking its value the binary returns a string such as:
- Invalid input sequence
- Input sequence ... maps to:  ...
- Input sequence has no mapping

I called the function that does all these checks `check_synt_sem`.
The `check_synt_sem` function takes 2 parameters,  the second one, `param_2` contains the string that you pass to the binary as input string.
This function first checks for each characters inside `param_2` if it's equal to one of the characters within a string stored in memory. To this string is concatenated as the first value `@`.
So here the function is checking the syntactic of the string that we gave as input to the binary, thus all the possible characters are:
`@A1C2E4H5K6M7P8R9UVWXYZ*~^&/:,;-`
