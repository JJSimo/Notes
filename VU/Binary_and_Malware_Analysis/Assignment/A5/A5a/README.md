# Find and explain conditions for syntactic/semantic validity and IR conversion 
By analyzing the binary in Ghidra, within the `main` function I found the function that performs all the checks for the syntactic and semantic validation, since its return value is assigned to a variable and by checking its value the binary returns a string such as:
- Invalid input sequence
- Input sequence ... maps to:  ...
- Input sequence has no mapping

I called the function that does all these checks `check_synt_sem`.
The `check_synt_sem` function takes 2 parameters,  the second one, `param_2` contains the string that you pass to the binary as input string.
## Check syntactic
This function first checks for each characters inside `param_2` if it's not equal to one of the characters within a string stored in memory. To this string is concatenated as the first value `@`.
So here the function is checking the syntactic of the string that we gave as input to the binary, thus all the possible characters are:
`@A1C2E4H5K6M7P8R9UVWXYZ*~^&/:,;-`  (I called this string `possible_chars`)

If a character inside the input string is not equal to one of the characters with `possible_chars`, the function also increments an index

The last instruction in the outer `while` loop, that is the loop that checks if the input string is terminated, checks if the index size. So one other syntactic check is that the input string must be 16 characters long.

After the inner while loop, the function performs the actual encoding.
