# Data flow Analysis
I started implementing the data flow analysis.
I created a Ghidra script in python to "simulate" the PIN tool behavior to instrument each instructions in all the functions within the array and propagate the taint if needed.

By analyzing some of the functions in Ghidra, I understood that in each function the input value is stored in `RDI` and the output value is contained in `RAX`.
Thus, a washer function is one in which if at the beginning of it `RDI` is tainted, then before return `RAX` is also tainted.
Whereas, in contrast, in a fake washer function `RAX` at the end is not tainted.

In my script I created 2 classes, a Registers class to manage the taint state of registers (at the start I supposed that only `RDI` is tainted), and the Stack class to handle stack operations (`PUSH` and `POP`).
Then, I disassembled each instruction of each function to "instrument" all the possible types of instructions and to propagate the taint where needed.
As I said before, when I instrumented each function, only RDI is tainted. 
Then for example I checked if the current instruction was a `MOV`, I verified if both
